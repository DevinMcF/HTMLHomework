    <h1>Special Characters</h1>

    Since &lt, &gt, and &amp have special meaning HTML, you can't use these characters to represent<br>
    themselves. Instead, you need to use so called "special characters" to represent them. For<br>
    example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &amplt; to represent it.
